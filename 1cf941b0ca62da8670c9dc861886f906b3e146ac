      "message": "If notifRecvCb is default-contsructed (and that happens when EvenWatcher\u0027s default ctor was used), then this ends up with a std::bad_function_call. Either remove that constructor, or use https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function/operator_bool here.\n\nLooking at the CI coverage, the second patch in the series removes invocation of EventWatcher\u0027s default ctor. If I understand this correctly and that default ctor won\u0027t be needed, just remove it and squash these patches together.",
