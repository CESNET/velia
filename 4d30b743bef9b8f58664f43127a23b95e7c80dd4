      "message": "Consider not building the C++ interface (that will have to be constantly updated as you add more implemented bits to YANG anyway), but instead taking the C-ish data structures as an input, and transforming them directly to libyang data structures as an output.\n\nI like wrapping the C bits in unique_ptr etc, as you\u0027ve already done. My advice is however against designing C++ classes such as  Rtnetlink::Netinfo.",
