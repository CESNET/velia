If I\u0027m correct, that\u0027s not how the system should work. What\u0027s the plan for supporting the autoconfiguration? (I\u0027m OK with this if it is only a temporary change, but I don\u0027t see a DHCP/SLAAC patch.)",

      "message": "This is of course a temporary change. I will state it in the commit message.\n\nIf the ipv4/ipv6 presence containers are{,not} present, it doesn\u0027t say anything about the (auto)configuration of the address (AFAIK). It does only say that the protocol is {en,dis}abled. I\u0027m not exactly sure what was you point. Could you please elaborate?\n\n\n\nI thought there is no big deal about those presence containers, that we don\u0027t have to care about them. But now I can see that we have to because of network file directives like LinkLocalAddressing (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html#LinkLocalAddressing\u003d) that default to something like \u003d\"ipv6\". The problem here is that the interface would get a link-local-address even if the ipv6 presence container does not exist.\nUnfortunately I don\u0027t see any option for \"disabling ipv{4,6} protocol altogether\" so I think we have to be careful about this and I hope this doesn\u0027t turn out to be something like \n if (!ipv6-presence)\n   disable_every_possible_option;",
