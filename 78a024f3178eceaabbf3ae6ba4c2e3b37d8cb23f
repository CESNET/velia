I *think* that right now a test which just takes a default-initialized Watcher and pushes into it new Thresholds which set critical low would trigger a state change now, while the desirable behavior is to not trigger any transition in that case.\n\nEven if I\u0027m wrong, initializing to a \"random\" value like the lowest possible one smells fishy now that it explicitly supports an empty state.",
