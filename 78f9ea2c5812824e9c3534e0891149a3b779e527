      "message": "This makes this code 100% CzechLight-specific. Perhaps it would make sense to use an --appliance parameter similar to how cla-sysrepo does that? Also, LED initialization is gonna be model-specific.\n\nPerhaps one of these appliances should be a \"dumb output\" mode where there\u0027s just a console handler for manager\u0027s state transitions (a dev typically has no LEDs that make sense for this purpose on their dev box, but it is useful to run this app anyway and just watch the log and the state changes, IMHO).",
