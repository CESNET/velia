      "message": "I am afraid that would require some augmentation to the model. The list of DNS resolvers is not ordered as I have noticed yesterday. It\u0027s just a list with the key (server name).\n\n\nAlso, I am not sure how to implement the \"config true\" part: I\u0027m not sure how to handle the interface-specific resolvers. Perhaps we can do something similar to what we did in networking:\n - startup/running DS stores the system-wide resolvers (i.e., it configures the DNS\u003d clause of systemd-resolved)\n - operational DS provides all the resolvers, including the interface-specific ones (as it does in this patch)\nBut that still does not allow to configure the interface-specific resolvers. This needs an augment in czechlight-system/network I guess.\n\nI think these are the questions for a call next week.",
