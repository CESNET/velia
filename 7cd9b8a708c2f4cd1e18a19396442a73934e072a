You define an optional string here, but when the caller puts a nullopt in there, then the process\u0027 stdin will never see EOF. And that, BTW, is the only difference between a nullopt and std::string{}, which makes me wonder if you really need an optional thingy in there.\n\nAlso, wouldn\u0027t a stringview be more appropriate in this context?\n\nAlso it would make sense to better describe that stderr gets ignored unless that process fails, etc.",
