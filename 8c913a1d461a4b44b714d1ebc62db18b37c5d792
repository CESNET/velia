In case there are duplicate keys in the maps the original value is kept and the new one is discarded (i.e., not merged in, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/merge).\n\nWe don\u0027t have duplicated values as of now but perhaps this small check could be worth it to save us some debugging time in the future.",
