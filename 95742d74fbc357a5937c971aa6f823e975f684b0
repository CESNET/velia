      "message": "On its own, I believe that this patch is misleading because it suggests that it\u0027s manipulating a default log level, while it is not actually doing that. Because all the other options have their default values, these defaults will overwrite whatever gets passed via the --log-level option.\n\nI see that you\u0027re trying to change that in the next patch, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that this patch provides a flag to the user which doesn\u0027t do what it says it is supposed to do.",
