I know we talked about this during Tuesday\u0027s (?) call, I remember that I was initially against this because I wanted to implement this at the state manager\u0027s output, and then you said something which made me change my mind. I don\u0027t remember what was that.",

      "message": "Well there is a problem that systemd sometimes emit PropertyChanged on a unit but the actual unit state (ActiveState and SubState, e.g. \"loaded running\" or \"activating auto-restart\") may not change.\n\nTherefore it sometimes happens that the code calls updateState from state A to state A several times in a row.\n\nThis is not not actually bad or wrong (it is actually only a \"not-so-cheap\" no-op on a manager) but it is pointless to do that.",
