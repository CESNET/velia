      "message": "I did some component checking as well (because the PSU\u0027s own margins are IMHO less important than the tolerance of the powered components):\n\n- clearfog base is happy with 9-32V\n- WSS \"A\": 4.75-5.25V\n- WSS \"A\": 11.4-12.6V\n- WSS \"B\": 4.75-5.25V\n- EDFA: \u003c\u003d5.5V\n- OCM \"A\": 3.3V, no tolerance specified\n- OCM \"B\": 4.75-5.25V\n- tap array: 4.75-5.25\n- SFP MSA: \"3.3V +/- 5%\", which yields 3.135-3.465V\n\nSo these numeric values are probably OK.\n\nI\u0027m a bit too nervous about the hysteresis which looks way too low to me, but honestly I don\u0027t know how to set it properly given that 5% of 3V is just 165mV... so let\u0027s take this one in as-is.",
