What would help more is assigning names to the get\u003c0\u003e and get\u003c6\u003e results; that way there would be no need for an extra comment, IMHO:\n \nfor (const auto\u0026 unit : units) {\n  const auto\u0026 name \u003d unit.get\u003c0\u003e();\n  if (ignoredUnits.find(name) \u003d\u003d ignoredUnits.end()) {\n    registerSystemdUnit(connection, name, unit.get\u003c6\u003e());\n  }\n}\n\nAlso C++20 would help as well (std::set::contains), but well, we don\u0027t have that yet :).",
