      "message": "What happens if this include gets accidentally removed later on, is that a compile-time error, or a runtime garbage in the logs? If it\u0027s a runtime garbage, then this needs a comment. If the compiler can catch this, is there a way to do that directly in the header as well via some static_assert?\n\nI\u0027m asking for \"something\" because I\u0027m not super-happy with a \"magic include\" that is \"not needed\", but when removed it \"break some other part of the code\". Perhaps I\u0027m mistaken because I haven\u0027t seen any such error before?",
