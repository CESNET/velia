If it\u0027s a runtime garbage, then this needs a comment. If the compiler can catch this, is there a way to do that directly in the header as well via some static_assert?\n\nI\u0027m asking for \"something\" because I\u0027m not super-happy with a \"magic include\" that is \"not needed\", but when removed it \"break some other part of the code\".

This enables some fmtlib automagic so it can pick up op\u003c\u003c(ostream\u0026, State) to use when formatting, e.g. in `logger-\u003eerror(\"state\u003d{}\", State{bar});` stmt.\nIn case the header is not included you get a compile error when used in formatting.\nIt is also a pattern we used before (a41d3d9b2).\n\n  $ git grep -n fmt/ostream \n  src/health/State.h:3:#include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n  src/ietf-hardware/thresholds_fwd.h:9:#include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n  src/system/LLDP.h:10:#include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n\n  $ git grep -n fmt/ostream | while IFS\u003d: read i j k; do git blame -f -L $j,$j $i; done\n  3 months ago    Tomáš Pecka     a41d3d9b2│  3 │ #include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n  a week ago      Tomáš Pecka     867206f98│  9 │ #include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n  3 months ago    Tomáš Pecka     a41d3d9b2│ 10 │ #include \u003cfmt/ostream.h\u003e\n\n\u003e If the compiler can catch this, is there a way to do that directly in the header as well via some static_assert?\n\nTo do what exactly?",

      "message": "Thanks for explaining this. My concern was that this include is \"not required\" for using/consuming this particular header, and I thought that someone might try to remove that #include in future. Check 74b885fd4ab2257c1022d624cccc083c7ce19c4e which added this header for the first time, it has a comment explaining why it\u0027s needed.\n\nNow, the static_assert I wanted you to consider would be a way of making that include mandatory in this header itself (or maybe in its associated .cpp file). Not terribly important, just a way of (potentially) saving some time after a too eager application of IWYU, for example.\n\nBut since it\u0027s a compile-time error, I\u0027m OK with this patch. Thanks for your patience :).",
