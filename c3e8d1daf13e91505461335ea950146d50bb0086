      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I see a big point of having these macros. If this was C++, I would have thought that it\u0027s about some type correctness where, for example, swapping the order like:\n\n FOO(ALARMS(a, b), COMPONENTS(c, d))\n\nvs:\n\n FOO(COMPONENTS(a, b), ALARMS(c, d))\n\n...would either do the right thing, or at least fail to compile. But since this is in a macro context, if you swap ALARMS and COMPONENTS, you\u0027ll get a test failure at runtime, so this is effectively just some fancy syntax sugar, right? If I was writing this, I would have probably stopped with the `VEC` macro.",
