      "message": "I would prefer if this started a bit simpler, just with a toggle for \"bridge eth1 into br0, or make it a separate one\". Doing that via a presence container, perhaps as a first step before we go with ietf-interfaces (hehehe) is a good idea, IMHO.\n\nMy recommendation is therefore to go with a \"/czechlight-system:network/standalone-eth1\" presence container, and still enable DHCP for that one. Once this part (which is, as you\u0027ve discovered, hard with systemd-networkd) is done, toggling between a DHCP for IPv4 and some static address should be \"rather easy\", \"just\" a matter of swapping a few lines in the resulting config file.",
