      "message": "We talked about this on Friday call. The TL;DR summary looks correct, but the implementation looks a bit complex to me for two reasons:\n\n- If the file is reopened, it will use another FD, at least for a while (because fopen first opens a file, and only then will ~unique_ptr perform the cleanup). That is a tiny bit wasteful, but it could also change behavior (library functions called with another FD and such).\n\n- The code will now produce duplicate values because any error effectively restarts the process from the very first record. That\u0027s also not a big issue because it is effectively masked by the resulting std::map, but there\u0027s no need to do it that way.\n\nMy recommendation is to simply store the file offset position before each fgetpwent_r call, and then restore via fseek in case of ERANGE.",
