Unfortunately the test cannot be trivially changed to adjust that printing :(. What about:\n \n// cannot use REQUIRE_ALARM_INVENTORY_ADD_ALARM here because the enclosing containers are reported \"created\" as well\n\n\n...and I see that it\u0027s already there in the other code, OK :), let\u0027s fix this later.",
