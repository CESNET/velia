      "message": "So, it works now, the problem was in CMake which needed both \u0027r\u0027 and \u0027x\u0027 on `sudo`, whereas it\u0027s tradditionally -r+x.\n\nThe first test failure (a timeout) is probably just a red herring, let\u0027s ignore that one.\n\nThe second test failure looks like something that happens because of the IPv6 configuration (SLAAC) where each link gets assigned a link-local IPv6 address. There\u0027s a sysctl knob (that the test MUST NOT change) for this, perhaps one can use that to accommodate various system configurations.",
