      "message": "This doesn\u0027t feel right to me; the mere fact that a method doesn\u0027t modify any class member variable does not, IMHO, mean that it\u0027s a const method. I consider the \"RAUC\" class to represent \"a handle\" to the system updater, not just the C++ code which implements the required interface. A const method should not, IMHO, change an object\u0027s state. This one surely does -- before the backend was idle, after I call this, something changes. (And yup, that state could change for any other external reason as well.)\n\nIf you insist on this, I\u0027m OK with merging it, but I wanted to mention this objection.",
