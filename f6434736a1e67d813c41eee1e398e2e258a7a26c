      "message": "I like it that the code actively tries to maintain the inventory, including the resource names, so that the consumers of the ietf-alarms YANG model will be kept up-to-date about all the systemd units which can fail. However, I think the code would be made easier if this is changed into a two-step process:\n\n1) At first, push a generic entry with an empty list of resources. This is safe, because we\u0027ve decided that sysrepo-ietf-alarms insists that any possible alarm (regardless of the reource list) will be always managed by a single sysrepo connection (which means that when this velia thingy starts, there are no matches in the inventory, even in face of crashes and restarts). Right?\n\n2) When a new systemd unit appears, just push it into the list of resources without any checks of the existing data.",
